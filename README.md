# Mario Kart Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project is a Python script that analyzes a list of Mario Kart race data. The data is structured as a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains a racer's name, the power-up items they collected, and their final race position.

The goal of the script is to process this data to determine which items are most frequently used by first-place finishers, providing insight into which items correlate with winning.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Save the code as a file named `analysis.py`.
3. Run the script from your terminal using the command: `python3 analysis.py`.

4. ## Example Output
When run with the sample data, the script produces the following output, showing a count of each item used by a winning racer:
